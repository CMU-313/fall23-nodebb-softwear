**How to View Changes**
When entering NodeBB, the homepage has four separate sections: Announcements, General Discussion, Comments & Feedback & Blogs. 
For each of these section, a user could create a post and reply to a different post. Both post and reply in high level are considered posts.

As an instructor, the user can click on the individual topics and see three dots on the right of each post and click either "Mark Post as Correct" or "Unmark Post".
When the instructor user clicks on "Mark Post as Correct", the indication (background color and endorse text) will appear that the post has been marked correct. 
When endorsing a reply, indications will both show on the thread view (that could be seen by clicking "n Reply xx minute(s)/hour(s)/day(s) ago") and the normal post reply view (a reply directly visible below post).
When unendorsing a reply, indications will be gone and turn into a normal post where no additional designs are applied from the original NodeBB post. 
Keep in mind no other type of user could endorse the post. More details could be seen below. 

As different types of users other than instructor, a user will still be able to see "Mark Post as Correct" or "Unmark Post" when clicking the three dots on the individual topics view. 
However, when clicking it, there will be an error generated at the bottom right saying "not-instructor" and the post will not be endorsed.
